## Usage

The `base/` folder holds all boilerplate code for a project. This is where
would would stick your reset, typography rules, animation `@keyframe`
definitions, among other files, depending on the specifics of the project. Also consider a stylesheet for standard styles for commonly used HTML
elements called `_base.scss`.
